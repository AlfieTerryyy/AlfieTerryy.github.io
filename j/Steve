        <h1>Welcome to Steve's Ham-tastic Adventure!</h1>
        <p>About Us:</p>
        <p>At Steve's, we believe in combining the unexpected. That's why we've merged two seemingly unrelated worlds: ham and kidnapping. Our founder, Steve, had a vision: to create a place where you can enjoy delicious cured meats while also experiencing the thrill of a lifetime. And thus, Steve's Local Kidnapper's Ham Shop & Van was born!</p>
        <p>Our Menu:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hammy Heists: Choose from our selection of premium hams, each with its own daring backstory. Will you go for the "Midnight Marauder" or the "Bacon Bandit"?</li>
            <li>Van Specials: Our food truck, aptly named "The Getaway Van," serves up ham sandwiches with a side of adrenaline. Try the "Pulled Pork Pursuit" or the "Salami Stakeout."</li>
            <li>Kidnapper's Combo: For the true thrill-seekers, we offer a combo meal that includes a ham sandwich, a getaway car keychain, and a simulated kidnapping experience. (Disclaimer: No actual kidnappings involved.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Customer Reviews:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"I never thought I'd enjoy ham and danger together, but Steve's made it happen!" – <em>Anonymous Adventurer</em></li>
            <li>"The ham was so good, I almost forgot I was being chased!" – <em>Evelyn, 5 stars</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Visit Us:</p>
        <p>Find us parked outside the local police station. Because nothing says "bold culinary choices" like setting up shop right under their noses!</p>
